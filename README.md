# Node.js Server Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when developing Node.js servers: the server seemingly starts but fails to respond to incoming requests.  The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Problem

The original code creates a simple HTTP server, but due to an omitted error handling mechanism, it doesn't properly handle potential errors during server startup.  This can cause the server to appear to start without correctly binding to the specified port or handling unexpected issues.

## Solution

The solution incorporates robust error handling using the `server.on('error', ...)` event listener.  This allows the server to gracefully handle various errors, such as port conflicts or permission issues, providing informative error messages to the console.  This ensures more reliable server startup and operation.
